flatland is a form and JSON input processing and validation library.

Philosphy
---------

flatland's design stems from a few basic tenets:

 - All input is suspect
 - Input can come from multiple sources and interfaces
 - Bad input isn't exceptional: it is expected

With flatland, you describe exactly what elements your form may
contain.  Forms extract and process only their known elements out of
the (key, value) input data.  Unexpected or malicious data will not be
processed.

The description of forms and their fields is data-centric rather than
HTML or interface-centric.  In a flatland form schema, a password
input field is simply a string, not a "PasswordInput" or the like. The
decision about how to represent that field is left up to another layer
entirely.  Maybe you do want a <INPUT type="password"> control, or
maybe type="hidden" in some cases, or sometimes the data is coming in
as JSON.  flatland can act as another type of M in your M/VC, MC or
MVC.

Humans are imperfect and filling out forms will always be
error-prone. flatland recognizes this and provides features to make
error detection and correction part of the regular workflow of a
form.  By default, validation routines will consider every element of
a form and mark all problematic fields, allowing users to take action
on all issues at once.

Introduction
------------

Field schemas define all possible fields the form may contain.  A
schema may a single field, a collection of fields, or an even richer
structure.  Nested mappings and lists of fields are supported, as well
as compound fields and even more exotic types.

.. testcode::

  from flatland import Form, String

  class SignInForm(Form):
      schema = [ String('username'),
                 String('password') ]

Field schemas are long-lived objects similar to class definitions.
The instantiations of a flatland schema are called data elements, a
tree structure of data-holding objects.  The elements of a flatland
form may be initiated blank, using default values, or with values
taken from your objects.

.. testsetup::

  class Mock(object):
      def __getattr__(self, key):
          return lambda *a, **kw: None
  request = logging = Mock()
  request.POST = [('username', 'jek'), ('password', 'p1')]
  redirect = request.redirect

.. testcode::

  form = SignInForm.from_flat(request.POST)
  if form.validate():
      logging.info(u"sign-in: %s" % form.el('username'))
      redirect('/app/')
  else:
      render('login.html', form=form)

Elements are rich objects that validate and normalize input data as
well as hold field-level error and warning messages.  Elements can be
exported to a native Python structure, flattened back into Unicode
key, value pairs or used as-is in output templates for form layout,
redisplay and error reporting.

.. doctest::

  >>> as_regular_python_data = form.value
  >>> type(as_regular_python_data)
  <type 'dict'>
  >>> as_regular_python_data['username']
  u'jek'
  >>> form2 = SignInForm.create_blank()
  >>> form2.set(as_regular_python_data)

  >>> assert form.el('username').value == form2.el('username').value

History
-------

flatland is a Python implementation of techniques I've been using for
form and web data processing for ages, in many different languages.
It is an immediate conceptual decendent and re-write of "springy", a
closed-source library used interally at Virtuous, Inc.  The Genshi
filter support was donated to the flatland project by Virtuous.
