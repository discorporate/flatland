*Status:* pre-release development

Pending Design Decisions
------------------------

 - polymorhically comparable Elements, friend or foe (foe +1)
 - the Form sugar is still only roughed in; no inheritance yet.
 - push set() up to FieldSchema?

Also Considering
----------------

  - For Elements: __html__, __json__

    - html is probably the .x

    - the .u on containers is close to json, except it currently spits
      out u'python' for strings (and the repr() of scalars, generally)

  - events on set(), validation

General Todos
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

 - improve the package long_description and make sure it's still true
