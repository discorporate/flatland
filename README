*Status:* pre-release development

TODO:

- schema
  Status: mostly stable
  - May rename Schema and Node; mostly internal
  - Probably push validate to Schema
  - Change .node()/.new() to .create() or similar
  - Tighten up the patterns for the main entry point, Form
    - See what inheritable forms look like. Additive only?
  - el.raw ; unprocessed input?
    - Had this before and it was handy.
    - But it's reconstructable from fq_name() and the original input source.
  - binops on container nodes aren't implemented yet and will probably
    fail in colorful ways.
  - Babelable field labels
  - Consider for Nodes: __html__, __json__
    - html is probably the .x
    - the .u on containers is close to json, except it spits out u'python'
      to be roundtripable in Python using any encoding
  - consider springy's .from_blank(), a node-tainting construction
    method that uses no defaults at any depth in the tree.

- validation
  Status: Heavy flux, trying on different approaches and sugars.
  - Optional strategy-objects or exceptions for things like Optional
  - Work in Babel mesaging
  - Overhaul the error vs. warnings at the same time (current is bogus)

- docs
  Status: minimal
  - Sphinx

- genshi template support
  Status: port not started
  - Need to port both to flatland and to modern Genshi
  - flatland nodes are usable in templates as-is. the template support
    is just whiz-bang.

- test suite
  Status: getting better
  - schema coverage pretty good, need compound fields



- springy / formmodel bitbucket
  Old things and patterns to consider
  - from_blank
  - from_defaults
  - Schema.prototype()
  - flat_apply
  - flat_str
  - flat_native
  - flat_nodes

- general tasks
 - Questionable python sweep (__slots__ e.g.)
 - probably need a trac
 - migrate to hg or git
 - bump out a 0.2
 - improve the package long_description and make sure it's still true
